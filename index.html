            <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Boulaug's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, lowa </li><Br>
                <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration" </li><Br>
                <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them",<br>
                he said."All of this left scars on me." </li><Br>
                <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service </li><Br>
                <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br>
                Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants. </li><Br>
                <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof <br>
                glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li><Br>
                <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li><Br>
                <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the <br>
                next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li><Br>
                <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li><Br>
                <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to <br>
                provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li><Br>
                <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly <br>
                expanding population</li>
                <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize </li><Br>
                <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li><Br>
                <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li><br>
                <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, <br>
                 as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. <br>
                Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>

                    towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
